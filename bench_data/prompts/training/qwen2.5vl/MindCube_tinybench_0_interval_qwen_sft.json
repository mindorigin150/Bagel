Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the right view, blue-gray chair should appear behind white table. This remains true even if blue-gray chair is partially or fully occluded by white table in the right view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Therefore, when transitioning from front view to right view, there is a blue-gray chair behind white table as a direct consequence of white table being right of blue-gray chair in the initial front view.

Image 3 (right view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees counterclockwise from image 1. When observing objects rubbish bin and wooden bench in the front view, where rubbish bin is positioned to the left of wooden bench, this spatial relationship transforms when viewing from the left view. Consider this: objects that appear more leftward in the front view become closer to the observer in the left view, while objects that appear more rightward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the left view, wooden bench should appear behind rubbish bin. This remains true even if wooden bench is partially or fully occluded by rubbish bin in the left view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions.  Therefore, when transitioning from front view to left view, there is a wooden bench behind rubbish bin as a direct consequence of rubbish bin being left of wooden bench in the initial front view.

When observing objects blue bench and blue bench in the back view, where blue bench is positioned to the right of blue bench, this spatial relationship transforms when viewing from the left view. Consider this: objects that appear more rightward in the back view become closer to the observer in the left view, while objects that appear more leftward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the left view, blue bench should appear behind blue bench. This remains true even if blue bench is partially or fully occluded by blue bench in the left view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Furthermore, to determine which object is directly behind a specific object in the left view (i.e., the nearest object behind it), we need to examine the front view arrangement: the object that appears immediately to the right of our reference object in the front view will be the nearest object behind it in the left view. This spatial transformation maintains the relative distances between objects. If this immediate neighbor is not among the available options, we should consider the next right object in sequence.

In image 1,  I can also see dark-green office chair on the left of the white round table. In image 2, I can see dark-green office chair clearly. In image 3, I can see black office chair clearly. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's orientation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects in the scene to support this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the front view of the scene. Image 2 (left view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees clockwise from image 1. Image 3 (right view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees counterclockwise from image 1. When observing objects black office chair and white round table in the front view, where black office chair is positioned to the right of white round table, this spatial relationship transforms when viewing from the right view. Consider this: objects that appear more rightward in the front view become closer to the observer in the right view, while objects that appear more leftward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the right view, white round table should appear behind black office chair. This remains true even if white round table is partially or fully occluded by black office chair in the right view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Furthermore, to determine which object is directly behind a specific object in the right view (i.e., the nearest object behind it), we need to examine the front view arrangement: the object that appears immediately to the left of our reference object in the front view will be the nearest object behind it in the right view. This spatial transformation maintains the relative distances between objects. If this immediate neighbor is not among the available options, we should consider the next left object in sequence. So the answer is A. White round table.</think><answer>A. above' from '</answer>"

Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the left view, books should appear behind sculpture of horse's head. This remains true even if books is partially or fully occluded by sculpture of horse's head in the left view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions.  Therefore, when transitioning from front view to left view, there is a books behind sculpture of horse's head as a direct consequence of sculpture of horse's head being left of books in the initial front view. So the answer is A. Yes.</think><answer>A. above' from '</answer>"

Objects that appear more leftward in the back view become closer to the observer in the right view, while objects that appear more rightward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the right view, small-wooden cabinet should appear in front of table. This remains true even if table is partially or fully occluded by small-wooden cabinet in the right view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Therefore, when transitioning from front view to right view, there is a table behind small-wooden cabinet as a direct consequence of small-wooden cabinet being right of table in the initial front view. So the answer is B. Yes.</think><answer>B. under</answer>"

Consider this: objects that appear more rightward in the front view become closer to the observer in the right view, while objects that appear more leftward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the right view, grey bin should appear behind blue bin. This remains true even if grey bin is partially or fully occluded by blue bin in the right view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Furthermore, to determine which object is directly behind a specific object in the right view (i.e., the nearest object behind it), we need to examine the front view arrangement: the object that appears immediately to the left of our reference object in the front view will be the nearest object behind it in the right view. This spatial transformation maintains the relative distances between objects. If this immediate neighbor is not among the available options, we should consider the next left object in sequence.

Image 3 (right view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees counterclockwise from image 1. When observing objects sofa  and white flowerpot in the front view, where sofa  is positioned to the right of white flowerpot, this spatial relationship transforms when viewing from the right view. Consider this: objects that appear more rightward in the front view become closer to the observer in the right view, while objects that appear more leftward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the right view, white flowerpot should appear behind sofa . This remains true even if white flowerpot is partially or fully occluded by sofa  in the right view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Therefore, when transitioning from front view to right view, there is a white flowerpot behind sofa  as a direct consequence of sofa  being right of white flowerpot in the initial front view.

Consider this: objects that appear more leftward in the front view become closer to the observer in the left view, while objects that appear more rightward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the left view, gray trash can should appear behind potted plants. This remains true even if gray trash can is partially or fully occluded by potted plants in the left view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Furthermore, to determine which object is directly behind a specific object in the left view (i.e., the nearest object behind it), we need to examine the front view arrangement: the object that appears immediately to the right of our reference object in the front view will be the nearest object behind it in the left view. This spatial transformation maintains the relative distances between objects. If this immediate neighbor is not among the available options, we should consider the next right object in sequence. So the answer is C. Gray trash can.</think><answer>C. front</answer>"

In image 1,  I can also see dark-green office chair on the left of the white round table. In image 2, I can see dark-green office chair clearly. In image 3, I can see black office chair clearly. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's orientation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects in the scene to support this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the back view of the scene. Image 2 (left view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees clockwise from image 1. Image 3 (right view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees counterclockwise from image 1. When observing objects black office chair and white round table in the back view, where black office chair is positioned to the left of white round table, this spatial relationship transforms when viewing from the right view. Objects that appear more leftward in the back view become closer to the observer in the right view, while objects that appear more rightward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the right view, black office chair should appear in front of white round table. This remains true even if white round table is partially or fully occluded by black office chair in the right view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Furthermore, to determine which object is directly behind a specific object in the right view (i.e., the nearest object behind it), we need to examine the front view arrangement: the object that appears immediately to the left of our reference object in the front view will be the nearest object behind it in the right view. This spatial transformation maintains the relative distances between objects. If this immediate neighbor is not among the available options, we should consider the next left object in sequence. So the answer is A. White round table.</think><answer>A. above' from '</answer>"

Image 3 (right view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees counterclockwise from image 1. When observing objects gray trash can and blue trash can in the front view, where gray trash can is positioned to the right of blue trash can, this spatial relationship transforms when viewing from the right view. Consider this: objects that appear more rightward in the front view become closer to the observer in the right view, while objects that appear more leftward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the right view, blue trash can should appear behind gray trash can. This remains true even if blue trash can is partially or fully occluded by gray trash can in the right view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Furthermore, to determine which object is directly behind a specific object in the right view (i.e., the nearest object behind it), we need to examine the front view arrangement: the object that appears immediately to the left of our reference object in the front view will be the nearest object behind it in the right view. This spatial transformation maintains the relative distances between objects. If this immediate neighbor is not among the available options, we should consider the next left object in sequence. So the answer is B. Blue trash can.</think><answer>B. under</answer>"

In image 1,  I can also see blue-and-orange square bin on the left of the blue trash can. In image 2, I can see blue-and-orange square bin clearly. In image 3, I can see orange trash can clearly. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's orientation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects in the scene to support this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the front view of the scene. Image 2 (left view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees clockwise from image 1. Image 3 (right view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees counterclockwise from image 1. When observing objects blue-and-orange square bin and blue trash can in the front view, where blue-and-orange square bin is positioned to the left of blue trash can, this spatial relationship transforms when viewing from the left view. Consider this: objects that appear more leftward in the front view become closer to the observer in the left view, while objects that appear more rightward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the left view, blue trash can should appear behind blue-and-orange square bin. This remains true even if blue trash can is partially or fully occluded by blue-and-orange square bin in the left view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions.  Therefore, when transitioning from front view to left view, there is a blue trash can behind blue-and-orange square bin as a direct consequence of blue-and-orange square bin being left of blue trash can in the initial front view.

In image 1,  I can also see bronze statue of man on the left of the bronze statue of woman. In image 2, I can see bronze statue of man clearly. In image 3, I can see bronze statue of woman clearly. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's orientation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects in the scene to support this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the front view of the scene. Image 2 (left view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees clockwise from image 1. Image 3 (right view) is captured after rotating around the scene 90 degrees counterclockwise from image 1. When observing objects bronze statue of man and bronze statue of woman in the front view, where bronze statue of man is positioned to the left of bronze statue of woman, this spatial relationship transforms when viewing from the left view. Consider this: objects that appear more leftward in the front view become closer to the observer in the left view, while objects that appear more rightward become farther away. Following the principle of depth perception, where closer objects appear in front of farther objects from the observer's perspective, we can conclude that in the left view, bronze statue of woman should appear behind bronze statue of man. This remains true even if bronze statue of woman is partially or fully occluded by bronze statue of man in the left view, as such occlusion actually validates our spatial reasoning about their relative positions. Furthermore, to determine which object is directly behind a specific object in the left view (i.e., the nearest object behind it), we need to examine the front view arrangement: the object that appears immediately to the right of our reference object in the front view will be the nearest object behind it in the left view. This spatial transformation maintains the relative distances between objects. If this immediate neighbor is not among the available options, we should consider the next right object in sequence. So the answer is B. Bronze statue of woman.</think><answer>B. under</answer>"

Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view wall and door behind red bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, wall and door is on the right side of red bottle.

In image 4, I can see color ball in front of the brown chair and table. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view black sofa behind color ball in the second view, it implies that in the first view, black sofa is on the right side of color ball. Similarly, when I see brown chair and table behind color ball in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, brown chair and table is on the left side of color ball. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As glass wall is observed behind color ball in the third view, it means that in the first view, glass wall is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As blue rubbish bin is observed behind office chair with blue seat in the third view, it means that in the first view, blue rubbish bin is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 2: blue rubbish bin is to the right of office chair with blue seat, table and microwave is to my behind, kitchenette is to the left of office chair with blue seat. So the answer is C. Kitchenette.</think><answer>C. front</answer>"

In image 1, I can see coffee table in front of the cream-colored cabinet. In image 2, I can see coffee table in front of the two blue leather armchairs. In image 3, I can see coffee table in front of the blue bin. In image 4, I can see coffee table in front of the table and white chair. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view two blue leather armchairs behind coffee table in the second view, it implies that in the first view, two blue leather armchairs is on the right side of coffee table. Similarly, when I see table and white chair behind coffee table in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, table and white chair is on the left side of coffee table. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As blue bin is observed behind coffee table in the third view, it means that in the first view, blue bin is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 4: cream-colored cabinet is to the right of coffee table, two blue leather armchairs is to my behind, blue bin is to the left of coffee table. So the answer is C.

Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view table with chairs behind drink bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, table with chairs is on the right side of drink bottle. Similarly, when I see white walls and windows behind drink bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, white walls and windows is on the left side of drink bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As wooden sofa is observed behind drink bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, wooden sofa is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 1: table with chairs is to the right of drink bottle, wooden sofa is to my behind, white walls and windows is to the left of drink bottle. So the answer is D. Table with chairs.</think><answer>D. behind.', your response should only be '</answer>"

Similarly, when I see clothes rack and black pants behind white thermos in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, clothes rack and black pants is on the left side of white thermos. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As white headboard is observed behind white thermos in the third view, it means that in the first view, white headboard is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 2: white headboard is to the right of white thermos, clothes rack and black pants is to my behind, table with cups on it is to the left of white thermos. So the answer is C. Clothes rack and black pants.</think><answer>C. front</answer>"

Image 2 seems to show the red chair and plastic container's left side compared to the first one. This suggests that, to transition from the viewpoint in the first image to the viewpoint in the second image, I need to move forward and to the left. Therefore, the answer is C.

Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view wooden dining table behind black sneaker in the second view, it implies that in the first view, wooden dining table is on the right side of black sneaker. Similarly, when I see brown curtains and windows behind black sneaker in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, brown curtains and windows is on the left side of black sneaker. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As light purple sofa is observed behind black sneaker in the third view, it means that in the first view, light purple sofa is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 1: wooden dining table is to the right of black sneaker, light purple sofa is to my behind, brown curtains and windows is to the left of black sneaker. So the answer is D. Light purple sofa.</think><answer>D. behind.', your response should only be '</answer>"

This involves tracking how key features shift positions, observing which elements become more prominent or less visible, and comparing if these observed changes align with the expected spatial transformations that would occur when viewing the object from its left or right side. Image 2 seems to show the yellow drink bottle's left side compared to the first one.

In image 3, I can see black chair with pillows in front of the two single sofas. In image 4, I can see black chair with pillows in front of the TV. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation.

Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view leather loveseat behind black chair with pillows in the second view, it implies that in the first view, leather loveseat is on the right side of black chair with pillows. Similarly, when I see TV behind black chair with pillows in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, TV is on the left side of black chair with pillows. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As two single sofas is observed behind black chair with pillows in the third view, it means that in the first view, two single sofas is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 4: leather loveseat with three seat cushions is to the right of black chair with pillows, leather loveseat is to my behind, two single sofas is to the left of black chair with pillows.

In image 2, I can see green jar in front of the white headboard. I notice that green jar is visible in both images, but from different angles. I analyze how the viewpoint changed from image 1 to image 2 by analyzing how the structural features of objects on the platform and relative positions of these objects transform between the two views. This involves tracking how key features shift positions, observing which elements become more prominent or less visible, and comparing if these observed changes align with the expected spatial transformations that would occur when viewing the object from its left or right side. Image 2 seems to show the green jar's left side compared to the first one. This suggests that, to transition from the viewpoint in the first image to the viewpoint in the second image, I need to move forward and to the left. Therefore, the answer is C.

Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view window behind wine bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, window is on the right side of wine bottle.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view leather loveseat behind white square stool with pillows in the second view, it implies that in the first view, leather loveseat is on the right side of white square stool with pillows.

Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view TV behind cup in the second view, it implies that in the first view, TV is on the right side of cup. Similarly, when I see white board behind cup in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, white board is on the left side of cup. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As wooden podium is observed behind cup in the third view, it means that in the first view, wooden podium is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

I analyze how the viewpoint changed from image 1 to image 2 by analyzing how the structural features of objects on the platform and relative positions of these objects transform between the two views. This involves tracking how key features shift positions, observing which elements become more prominent or less visible, and comparing if these observed changes align with the expected spatial transformations that would occur when viewing the object from its left or right side. Image 2 seems to show the black chair with pillows's right side compared to the first one.

In image 1, I can see office chair with blue seat in front of the kitchenette. In image 2, I can see office chair with blue seat in front of the single sofa and small table. In image 3, I can see office chair with blue seat in front of the blue rubbish bin. In image 4, I can see office chair with blue seat in front of the table and microwave. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view single sofa and small table behind office chair with blue seat in the second view, it implies that in the first view, single sofa and small table is on the right side of office chair with blue seat. Similarly, when I see table and microwave behind office chair with blue seat in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, table and microwave is on the left side of office chair with blue seat.

This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view leather loveseat behind white square stool with pillows in the second view, it implies that in the first view, leather loveseat is on the right side of white square stool with pillows.

This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view kitchen behind gray sports kettle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, kitchen is on the right side of gray sports kettle. Similarly, when I see plain wall behind gray sports kettle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, plain wall is on the left side of gray sports kettle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As window and fridge is observed behind gray sports kettle in the third view, it means that in the first view, window and fridge is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 3: plain wall is to the right of gray sports kettle, cabinet and chair is to my behind, kitchen is to the left of gray sports kettle. So the answer is A.

In image 3, I can see green facial cleanser in front of the white headboard. In image 4, I can see green facial cleanser in front of the clothes rack and black pants. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view bed sheet with a floral pattern behind green facial cleanser in the second view, it implies that in the first view, bed sheet with a floral pattern is on the right side of green facial cleanser. Similarly, when I see clothes rack and black pants behind green facial cleanser in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, clothes rack and black pants is on the left side of green facial cleanser. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As white headboard is observed behind green facial cleanser in the third view, it means that in the first view, white headboard is positioned behind me.

In image 3, I can see pink bottle in front of the closet and door. In image 4, I can see pink bottle in front of the white wall. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view pink plush toy and headboard behind pink bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, pink plush toy and headboard is on the right side of pink bottle. Similarly, when I see white wall behind pink bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, white wall is on the left side of pink bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As closet and door is observed behind pink bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, closet and door is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

In image 3, I can see black chair with pillows in front of the two single sofas. In image 4, I can see black chair with pillows in front of the TV.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view leather loveseat behind black chair with pillows in the second view, it implies that in the first view, leather loveseat is on the right side of black chair with pillows.

This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 2: after turning left, black chair with pillows is now to my right, leather loveseat with three seat cushions is now to my front-right.

Similarly, when I see brown curtains and windows behind black shoe in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, brown curtains and windows is on the left side of black shoe. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As light purple sofa is observed behind black shoe in the third view, it means that in the first view, light purple sofa is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 2: light purple sofa is to the right of black shoe, brown curtains and windows is to my behind, TV is to the left of black shoe. So the answer is D.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view wall behind black + white sneaker in the second view, it implies that in the first view, wall is on the right side of black + white sneaker. Similarly, when I see white headboard behind black + white sneaker in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, white headboard is on the left side of black + white sneaker.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view window behind yellow jar in the second view, it implies that in the first view, window is on the right side of yellow jar.

Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view two blue leather armchairs behind coffee table in the second view, it implies that in the first view, two blue leather armchairs is on the right side of coffee table. Similarly, when I see table and white chair behind coffee table in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, table and white chair is on the left side of coffee table. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As blue bin is observed behind coffee table in the third view, it means that in the first view, blue bin is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 1: two blue leather armchairs is to the right of coffee table, blue bin is to my behind, table and white chair is to the left of coffee table. So the answer is D. Two blue leather armchairs.</think><answer>D. behind.', your response should only be '</answer>"

Image 2 seems to show the gray sports kettle's right side compared to the first one.

Similarly, when I see fridge behind wine bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, fridge is on the left side of wine bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As light blue bedding and pillows is observed behind wine bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, light blue bedding and pillows is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 2: after turning right, wine bottle is now to my left, light blue bedding and pillows is now to my front-left.  If I move forward, I wll be closer to the light blue bedding and pillows. So the answer is A. Yes.</think><answer>A. above' from '</answer>"

In image 3, I can see green facial cleanser in front of the white headboard. In image 4, I can see green facial cleanser in front of the clothes rack and black pants. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view bed sheet with a floral pattern behind green facial cleanser in the second view, it implies that in the first view, bed sheet with a floral pattern is on the right side of green facial cleanser. Similarly, when I see clothes rack and black pants behind green facial cleanser in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, clothes rack and black pants is on the left side of green facial cleanser. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As white headboard is observed behind green facial cleanser in the third view, it means that in the first view, white headboard is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view white cabinet behind office chair with blue seat in the second view, it implies that in the first view, white cabinet is on the right side of office chair with blue seat.

In image 1, I can see table with black clothes in front of the white board. In image 2, I can see table with black clothes in front of the door. In image 3, I can see table with black clothes in front of the classroom seating area. In image 4, I can see table with black clothes in front of the lectern. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view door behind table with black clothes in the second view, it implies that in the first view, door is on the right side of table with black clothes. Similarly, when I see lectern behind table with black clothes in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, lectern is on the left side of table with black clothes. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As classroom seating area is observed behind table with black clothes in the third view, it means that in the first view, classroom seating area is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 4: after turning left, table with black clothes is now to my right, classroom seating area is now to my front-right.

Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view door behind red bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, door is on the right side of red bottle.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view window behind blue ball in the second view, it implies that in the first view, window is on the right side of blue ball. Similarly, when I see wall behind blue ball in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, wall is on the left side of blue ball.

In image 1, I can see yellow drink bottle in front of the white board and black chairs. In image 2, I can see yellow drink bottle in front of the black chairs. In image 3, I can see yellow drink bottle in front of the wall. In image 4, I can see yellow drink bottle in front of the glass wall and black chairs. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view black chairs behind yellow drink bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, black chairs is on the right side of yellow drink bottle. Similarly, when I see glass wall and black chairs behind yellow drink bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, glass wall and black chairs is on the left side of yellow drink bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view.

In image 1, I can see drink bottle in front of the stone fountain. In image 2, I can see drink bottle in front of the decorated wall. In image 3, I can see drink bottle in front of the light brown wall. In image 4, I can see drink bottle in front of the gate. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view decorated wall behind drink bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, decorated wall is on the right side of drink bottle. Similarly, when I see gate behind drink bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, gate is on the left side of drink bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As light brown wall is observed behind drink bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, light brown wall is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 4: stone fountain is to the right of drink bottle, decorated wall is to my behind, light brown wall is to the left of drink bottle. So the answer is C. Light brown wall.</think><answer>C. front</answer>"

In image 1, I can see gray sports kettle in front of the cabinet and chair. In image 2, I can see gray sports kettle in front of the kitchen. In image 3, I can see gray sports kettle in front of the window and fridge. In image 4, I can see gray sports kettle in front of the plain wall. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view kitchen behind gray sports kettle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, kitchen is on the right side of gray sports kettle. Similarly, when I see plain wall behind gray sports kettle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, plain wall is on the left side of gray sports kettle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As window and fridge is observed behind gray sports kettle in the third view, it means that in the first view, window and fridge is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 3: plain wall is to the right of gray sports kettle, cabinet and chair is to my behind, kitchen is to the left of gray sports kettle. So the answer is D.

In image 3, I can see black chair with pillows in front of the two single sofas. In image 4, I can see black chair with pillows in front of the TV. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view leather loveseat behind black chair with pillows in the second view, it implies that in the first view, leather loveseat is on the right side of black chair with pillows. Similarly, when I see TV behind black chair with pillows in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, TV is on the left side of black chair with pillows. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As two single sofas is observed behind black chair with pillows in the third view, it means that in the first view, two single sofas is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 2: after turning right, black chair with pillows is now to my left, two single sofas is now to my front-left.

In image 1, I can see yellow drink bottle in front of the black chair. In image 2, I can see yellow drink bottle in front of the window. In image 3, I can see yellow drink bottle in front of the display shelves and window. In image 4, I can see yellow drink bottle in front of the brown wall. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view window behind yellow drink bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, window is on the right side of yellow drink bottle. Similarly, when I see brown wall behind yellow drink bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, brown wall is on the left side of yellow drink bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As display shelves and window is observed behind yellow drink bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, display shelves and window is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 3: after turning right, yellow drink bottle is now to my left, brown wall is now to my front-left.  If I move forward, I wll be closer to the brown wall.

In image 4, I can see red bottle in front of the curtain. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view door behind red bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, door is on the right side of red bottle. Similarly, when I see curtain behind red bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, curtain is on the left side of red bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As grey sofa and wooden chair is observed behind red bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, grey sofa and wooden chair is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view decorated wall behind drink bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, decorated wall is on the right side of drink bottle. Similarly, when I see gate behind drink bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, gate is on the left side of drink bottle.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view single sofa and small table behind office chair with blue seat in the second view, it implies that in the first view, single sofa and small table is on the right side of office chair with blue seat.

This involves tracking how key features shift positions, observing which elements become more prominent or less visible, and comparing if these observed changes align with the expected spatial transformations that would occur when viewing the object from its left or right side. Image 2 seems to show the color ball's left side compared to the first one.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view grey chairs behind yellow ball in the second view, it implies that in the first view, grey chairs is on the right side of yellow ball.

In image 3, I can see white thermos in front of the white headboard. In image 4, I can see white thermos in front of the clothes rack and black pants. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation.

Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view bed sheet with a floral pattern behind white thermos in the second view, it implies that in the first view, bed sheet with a floral pattern is on the right side of white thermos. Similarly, when I see clothes rack and black pants behind white thermos in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, clothes rack and black pants is on the left side of white thermos. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As white headboard is observed behind white thermos in the third view, it means that in the first view, white headboard is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

Similarly, when I see gate behind drink bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, gate is on the left side of drink bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As light brown wall is observed behind drink bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, light brown wall is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 4: after turning left, drink bottle is now to my right, light brown wall is now to my front-right.  If I move forward, I wll be closer to the light brown wall. So the answer is B. Yes.</think><answer>B. under</answer>"

Image 2 seems to show the office chair with blue seat's right side compared to the first one.

Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view gridded glass wall behind white table in the second view, it implies that in the first view, gridded glass wall is on the right side of white table. Similarly, when I see TV behind white table in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, TV is on the left side of white table. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As glass door is observed behind white table in the third view, it means that in the first view, glass door is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 2: glass door is to the right of white table, TV is to my behind, glass wall is to the left of white table. So the answer is B. TV.</think><answer>B. under</answer>"

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view a corridor with a glass feature and black chair behind black chair in the second view, it implies that in the first view, a corridor with a glass feature and black chair is on the right side of black chair. Similarly, when I see glass door behind black chair in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, glass door is on the left side of black chair. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As safety exit sign is observed behind black chair in the third view, it means that in the first view, safety exit sign is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 4: yellow wall is to the right of black chair, a corridor with a glass feature and black chair is to my behind, safety exit sign is to the left of black chair. So the answer is A. A corridor with a glass feature and black chair.</think><answer>A. above' from '</answer>"

In image 4, I can see red bottle in front of the curtain. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view door behind red bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, door is on the right side of red bottle. Similarly, when I see curtain behind red bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, curtain is on the left side of red bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As grey sofa and wooden chair is observed behind red bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, grey sofa and wooden chair is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 4: after turning left, red bottle is now to my right, grey sofa and wooden chair is now to my front-right.

Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view bed sheet with a floral pattern behind green facial cleanser in the second view, it implies that in the first view, bed sheet with a floral pattern is on the right side of green facial cleanser. Similarly, when I see clothes rack and black pants behind green facial cleanser in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, clothes rack and black pants is on the left side of green facial cleanser. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As white headboard is observed behind green facial cleanser in the third view, it means that in the first view, white headboard is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 2: after turning left, green facial cleanser is now to my right, table with cups on it is now to my front-right.  If I move forward, I wll be closer to the table with cups on it. So the answer is A. Yes.</think><answer>A. above' from '</answer>"

In image 1, I can see white thermos in front of the table with cups on it. In image 2, I can see white thermos in front of the bed sheet with a floral pattern. In image 3, I can see white thermos in front of the white headboard. In image 4, I can see white thermos in front of the clothes rack and black pants. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view bed sheet with a floral pattern behind white thermos in the second view, it implies that in the first view, bed sheet with a floral pattern is on the right side of white thermos. Similarly, when I see clothes rack and black pants behind white thermos in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, clothes rack and black pants is on the left side of white thermos. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As white headboard is observed behind white thermos in the third view, it means that in the first view, white headboard is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 1: after turning right, white thermos is now to my left, bed sheet with a floral pattern is now to my front-left.  If I move forward, I wll be closer to the bed sheet with a floral pattern. So the answer is B. Yes.</think><answer>B. under</answer>"

In image 4, I can see yellow ball in front of the open space. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view grey chairs behind yellow ball in the second view, it implies that in the first view, grey chairs is on the right side of yellow ball. Similarly, when I see open space behind yellow ball in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, open space is on the left side of yellow ball. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As wall is observed behind yellow ball in the third view, it means that in the first view, wall is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view window behind blue ball in the second view, it implies that in the first view, window is on the right side of blue ball.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view wooden dining table behind black shoe in the second view, it implies that in the first view, wooden dining table is on the right side of black shoe. Similarly, when I see brown curtains and windows behind black shoe in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, brown curtains and windows is on the left side of black shoe.

In image 3, I can see office chair with blue seat in front of the blue rubbish bin. In image 4, I can see office chair with blue seat in front of the table and microwave. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view single sofa and small table behind office chair with blue seat in the second view, it implies that in the first view, single sofa and small table is on the right side of office chair with blue seat. Similarly, when I see table and microwave behind office chair with blue seat in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, table and microwave is on the left side of office chair with blue seat. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As blue rubbish bin is observed behind office chair with blue seat in the third view, it means that in the first view, blue rubbish bin is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 3: table and microwave is to the right of office chair with blue seat, kitchenette is to my behind, single sofa and small table is to the left of office chair with blue seat. So the answer is C. Table and microwave.</think><answer>C. front</answer>"

In image 3, I can see green jar in front of the bed sheet with a floral pattern. In image 4, I can see green jar in front of the white headboard. To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view table with cups on it behind green jar in the second view, it implies that in the first view, table with cups on it is on the right side of green jar. Similarly, when I see white headboard behind green jar in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, white headboard is on the left side of green jar. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As bed sheet with a floral pattern is observed behind green jar in the third view, it means that in the first view, bed sheet with a floral pattern is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene. So, from the perspective of image 3: white headboard is to the right of green jar, clothes rack is to my behind, table with cups on it is to the left of green jar. So the answer is B.

Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view small table with books inside behind white board in the second view, it implies that in the first view, small table with books inside is on the right side of white board. Similarly, when I see office chair with blue seat behind white board in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, office chair with blue seat is on the left side of white board.

To identify the position change across views, I focus on the main object's angle variation. Then, I analyze the angles and relative positions of other objects on the platform to back up this observation. I understand that:  Image 1 is the initial view. Image 2 is captured after a 90-degree clockwise rotation from image 1. Image 3 is after another 90-degree clockwise rotation (180 degrees from image 1). Image 4 is after a further 90-degree clockwise rotation (270 degrees from image 1). Through analyzing these perspective changes, I can construct a complete spatial understanding: when I view red stool behind yellow bottle in the second view, it implies that in the first view, red stool is on the right side of yellow bottle. Similarly, when I see light-colored sofa behind yellow bottle in the fourth view, it indicates that in the first view, light-colored sofa is on the left side of yellow bottle. However, I am still uncertain about what lies behind me in the first view. Then, I recognize that I can examine the opposite view to find out. The opposite view of the fist view is the third view. As cabinet and potted plant is observed behind yellow bottle in the third view, it means that in the first view, cabinet and potted plant is positioned behind me. This way, I can fully comprehend the spatial relationships of all objects in the entire scene.
